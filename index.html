        <h2>DIVING IN</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="bigLetter">
          The browser location bar is perhaps the geekiest mainstream piece of
          user interface in the world. There are URLs on billboards, on the
          sides of trains, and even in street graffiti. Combined with the back
          button — easily the most important button in the browser — you have a
          powerful way to go forward and backward through the vast set of
          intertwingled resources called the Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="#">HTML5 history API</a> is a standardized way to
          manipulate the browser history via script. Part of this API —
          navigating the history — has been available in previous versions of
          HTML. The new parts in HTML5 include a way to add entries to the
          browser history, to visibly change the URL in the browser location bar
          (without triggering a page refresh), and an event that fires when
          those entries are removed from the stack by the user pressing the
          browser’s back button. This means that the URL in the browser location
          bar can continue to do its job as a unique identifier for the current
          resource, even in script-heavy applications that don’t ever perform a
          full page refresh.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">
          THE WHY
        </h2>
        <img
          src="http://diveintohtml5.info/i/openclipart.org_johnny_automatic_demon_reading_Stewart_Orr.png"
          alt="demon reading book"
          width="218"
          height="231"
          style="float: left;"
        />
        <p>
          Why would you manually manipulate the browser location? After all, a
          simple link can navigate to a new URL; that’s the way the web has
          worked for 20 years. And it will continue to work that way. This API
          doesn’t try to subvert the web. Just the opposite. In recent years,
          web developers have found new and exciting ways of subverting the web
          without any help from emerging standards. The HTML5 history API is
          actually designed to ensure that URLs continue to be useful in
          script-heavy web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to first principles, what does a URL do? It identifies a
          unique resource. You can link to it directly; you can bookmark it;
          search engines can index it; you can copy and paste it and email it to
          someone else, who can click it and end up seeing the same resource you
          saw originally. These are all excellent qualities. URLs matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          So we want unique resources to have unique URLs. But at the same time,
          browsers have always had a fundamental limitation: if you change the
          URL, even through script, it triggers a roundtrip to the remote web
          server and a full page refresh. This takes time and resources, and it
          seems especially wasteful when you are navigating to a page that is
          substantially similar to the current page. Everything on the new page
          gets downloaded, even the parts that are exactly the same as the
          current page. There is no way tell a browser to change the URL but
          only download half a page.
        </p>

        <p>
          The HTML5 history API lets you do this. Instead of triggering a full
          page refresh, you can use script to, in essence, download half a page.
          This illusion is tricky to pull off, and it requires some work on your
          part. Are you watching closely?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img
          src="http://diveintohtml5.info/i/openclipart.org_johnny_automatic_card_trick.png"
          width="287"
          height="238"
          style="float: right"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Let’s say you have two pages, page A and page B. The two pages are 90%
          identical; only 10% of the page content is different. The user
          navigates to page A, then tries to navigate to page B. But instead of
          triggering a full page refresh, you interrupt this navigation and do
          the following steps manually:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Load the 10% of the page</i> from page B that is different from
            page A (probably using XMLHttpRequest). This will require some
            server-side changes to your web application. You will need to write
            code to return just the 10% of page B that is different from page A.
            This can be a hidden URL or query parameter that the end user would
            not normally see.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Swap in the changed content</i> (using innerHTML or other DOM
            methods). You may also need to reset any event handlers on elements
            within the swapped-in content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Update the browser location bar</i> with the URL of page B, using
            a particular method from the HTML5 history API that I’ll show you in
            a moment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At the end of this illusion (if you executed it correctly), the
          browser ends up with a DOM that is identical to page B, just as if you
          had navigated to page B directly. The browser location bar ends up
          with a URL that is identical to page B, just as if you had navigated
          to page B directly. But you never really did navigate to page B, and
          you never did a full page refresh. That’s the illusion. But because
          the “compiled” page looks the same as page B and has the same URL as
          page B, the user should never notice the difference (nor appreciate
          all your hard work micromanaging their experience).

      <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">THE HOW</h2>
        <p>
          The HTML5 history API is just a handful of methods on the
          window.history object, plus one event on the window object. You can
          use these to <a href="#">detect support for the history API</a>.
          Support is currently limited to the very latest versions of a few
          browsers, putting these techniques squarely in the “progressive
          enhancement” camp.

        <p>
          <a href="#">dive into dogs</a> is a straightforward but non-trivial
          example of using the HTML5 history API. It demonstrates a common
          pattern: a long article with an associated inline photo gallery. In a
          supported browser, navigating the Next and Previous links in the photo
          gallery will update the photo in place
          <i>and update the URL in the browser location bar</i>, without
          triggering a full page refresh. In unsupported browsers — or, indeed,
          supported browsers where the user has disabled scripting — the links
          simply function as regular links, taking you to a new page with a full
          page refresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s dig into the
          <a href="#">dive into dogs</a> demo and see how it works. This is the
          relevant markup for a single photo:
        </p>
        <h4>The pledge</h4>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;aside id="gallery"&gt;
              &lt;p class="photonav"&gt;
                &lt;a id="photonext" href="#"&gt;Next &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;a id="photoprev" href="#"&gt;&amp;lt; Previous&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure id="photo"&gt;
                &lt;img id="photoimg" src="gallery/1972-fer-500.jpg"
                        alt="Fer" width="500" height="375"&gt;
                &lt;figcaption&gt;Fer, 1972&lt;/figcaption&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/aside&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Nothing unusual there. The photo itself is an &lt;img&gt; inside a
          &lt;figure&gt;, the links are just regular &lt;a&gt; elements, and the
          entire thing is wrapped in an &lt;aside&gt;. It’s important that these
          are just regular links that actually work. All the code that follows
          is behind a
          <a href="#">detection script</a>. If the user is using an unsupported
          browser, none of our fancy history API code will ever be executed. And
          of course, there’s always some users with scripting disabled
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main driver function gets each of these links and passes it to a
          function, addClicker(), which does the actual work of setting up the
          custom click handler.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function setupHistoryClicks() {
              addClicker(document.getElementById("photonext"));
              addClicker(document.getElementById("photoprev"));
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This is the addClicker() function. It takes an &lt;a&gt; element and
          adds a click handler. And within this click handler is where it gets
          interesting.
        </p>
        <pre style="float: left">
          <code>
              function addClicker(link) {
              link.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
                swapPhoto(link.href);
                history.pushState(null, null, link.href);
                e.preventDefault();
              }, false);
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 150px; float: right;">&lt- Interesting</h4>
        <p style="clear:left">
          The swapPhoto() function performs the first two steps of our
          <a href="#illusion">three-step illusion</a>. The first half of the
          swapPhoto() function takes part of the URL of the navigation link
          itself — casey.html, adagio.html, <i>&amp;</i>c. — and constructs a
          URL to a hidden page that contains nothing but the markup required by
          the next photo.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function swapPhoto(href) {
            var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
            req.open("GET",
                     "http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/gallery/" +
                       href.split("/").pop(),
                     false);
            req.send(null);
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here is a sample of the markup returned by
          <a href="#"
            >http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/gallery/casey.html</a
          >. (You can verify this in your browser by visiting that URL
          directly.)
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;p class="photonav"&gt;
              &lt;a id="photonext" href="brandy.html"&gt;Next &amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;a id="photoprev" href="fer.html"&gt;&amp;lt; Previous&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure id="photo"&gt;
              &lt;img id="photoimg" src="gallery/1984-casey-500.jpg"
                      alt="Casey" width="500" height="375"&gt;
              &lt;figcaption&gt;Casey, 1984&lt;/figcaption&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Does that look familiar? It should. It’s the
          <a href="#">same basic markup that the original page used</a>
          to display the first photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second half of the swapPhoto() function performs the second step
          of our <a href="#">three-step illusion</a>: inserting this newly
          downloaded markup into the current page. Remember that there is an
          &lt;aside&gt; wrapping the entire figure, photo, and caption. So
          inserting the new photo markup is a one-liner, setting the innerHTML
          property of the &lt;aside&gt; to the responseText property returned
          from XMLHttpRequest.

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          (Also notice the call to <code>setupHistoryClicks()</code>. This is
          necessary to reset the custom <code>click</code> event handlers on the
          newly inserted navigation links. Setting <code>innerHTML</code> wipes
          out any trace of the old links and their event handlers.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let’s go back to the <code>addClicker()</code> function. After
          successfully swapping out the photo, there’s one more step in our
          <a href="#illusion">three-step illusion</a>: setting the URL in the
          browser location bar without refreshing the page.
        </p>
        <h4 style="padding-left: 100px">
          ↓ The turn
        </h4>
        <pre>
          <code>history.pushState(null, null, link.href);</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The history.pushState() function takes three parameters:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            state can be any JSON data structure. It is passed back to the
            popstate event hander, which you’ll learn about in just a moment. We
            don’t need to track any state in this demo, so I’ve left it as null.
          </li>
          <li>
            title can be any string. This parameter is currently unused by major
            browsers. If you want to set the page title, you should store it in
            the state argument and set it manually in your popstate callback.
          </li>
          <li>
            url can be, well, any URL. This is the URL you want to appear in the
            browser’s location bar.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Calling history.pushState will immediately change the URL in the
          browser’s location bar. So is that the end of the illusion? Well, not
          quite. We still need to talk about what happens when the user presses
          the all-important back button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally when the user navigates to a new page (with a full page
          refresh), the browser pushes the new URL onto its history stack and
          downloads and draws the new page. When the user presses the back
          button, the browser pops one page off its history stack and redraws
          the previous page. But what happens now that you’ve short-circuited
          this navigation to avoid a full page refresh? Well, you’ve faked
          “moving forward” to a new URL, so now you also need to fake “moving
          backward” to the previous URL. And the key to faking “moving
          backwards” is the popstate event.
        </p>

        </pre>
        <p>
          After you’ve used the history.pushState() function to push a fake URL
          onto the browser’s history stack, when the user presses the back
          button, the browser will fire a popstate event on the window object.
          This is your chance to complete the illusion once and for all. Because
          making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.

          In this demonstration, “bringing it back” is as simple as swapping in
          the original photo, which we do by calling the swapPhoto() with the
          current location. By the time your popstate callback is called, the
          URL visible in the browser’s location bar has been changed to the
          previous URL. Also, the global location property has already been
          updated with the previous URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help you visualize this, let’s step through the entire illusion
          from the beginning to the end:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User loads
            <a href="#">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/fer.html</a>
            , sees story and a photo of Fer.
          </li>
          <li>
            User clicks the link labeled “Next,” an &lt;a&gt; element whose href
            property is
            <a href="#">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of navigating
            <a href="#"
              >http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a
            >
            with a full page refresh, the custom click handler on the &lt;a&gt;
            element traps the click and executes its own code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our custom click handler calls the swapPhoto() function, which
            creates an XMLHttpRequest object to synchronously download the HTML
            snippet located at
            <a href="#"
              >http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/<strong>gallery</strong>/casey.html</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            The swapPhoto() function sets the innerHTML property of the photo
            gallery wrapper (an &lt;aside&gt; element), thereby replacing the
            captioned photo of Fer with a captioned photo of Casey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, our custom click handler calls the history.pushState()
            function to manually change the URL in the browser’s location bar to
            <a href="#">http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/casey.html</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>User clicks the browser’s back button.</li>
          <li>
            The browser notices that a URL has been manually pushed onto the
            history stack (by the history.pushState() function). Instead of
            navigating to the previous URL and redrawing the entire page, the
            browser simply updates the location bar to the previous URL (<a
              href="#"
              >http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/fer.html</a
            >) and fires a popstate event.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our custom popstate handler calls the swapPhoto() function again,
            this time with the previous URL that by now is already visible in
            the browser’s location bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Again using XMLHttpRequest, the swapPhoto() function downloads a
            snippet of HTML located at
            <a href="#"
              >http://diveintohtml5.info/examples/history/<b>gallery</b>/fer.html</a
            >
            and sets the innerHTML property of the &lt;aside&gt; wrapper
            element, thereby replacing the captioned photo of Casey with a
            captioned photo of Fer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The illusion is complete. All visible evidence (the content of the
          page, and the URL in the location bar) suggests to the user that they
          have navigated forward one page and backward one page. But no full
          page refresh ever occurred — it was all a meticulously executed
          illusion.
